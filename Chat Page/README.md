creative portion:

We have given admins the ability to add more admins to each chatroom. With this ability, every admin will be able to add other admins by username by typing into a form. When added, the recipient immediately is given admin privileges without having to refresh the page.

We also created a "trusted friends" feature, where users may add friends on the homepage by name. Trusted friends will be made admins of a chat room if they have a friend in the chatroom who is an admin. When each user joins a chat room, the program will check if any friends in the chat room are admins, and if they are, the friend will also become an admin.



Note: there is no alert for making someone a "trusted friend". This can be tested by joining the same chat as the new friend and check if they have become an admin
